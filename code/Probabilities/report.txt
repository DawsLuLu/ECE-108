Question 1:

From my simulation, as i increase the number of rolls, the chances of the six faces of the die 
becomes more and more equal. This makes sense as you increase the number of rolls, the more accurate 
your experiment, and the less chance for some unlikely combination to occur. Occasionally, one of
 the faces will land zero times in 10 rolls. This does not mean that there is no way for that certain 
face to appear. The probablylity of this dramaticaly decreases as you increase the number of rolls.

Question 2:

From my simulation, there is only about 8% chance that there is exactly an even split
between the occurence of low and high values in 100 rolls, after performing 10,000 experiments.
This is surprizing as you would think that the chance of a even split is 1/100 and thus 
running the trial 10000 times means that there should be 100 even splits out of 10000, 
a chance of 1%. However, according to mathematics, if there can only be two values, low value or high value, then
we are expecting 50 of them are low and the other 50 are high. We are essentially
choosing 50 from 100 (100 C 50). Then the total possibilites are 2^100 for 100 rolls
due to two possible values: high or low, thusthe chance of getting equal amounts of high 
value and low value is: (100 C 50) / 2^100, which is approximately 8%.

Question 3:
From my simulation, it can be observed that the chance of each sum occuring, from 2 to 12,
are approximately: 

3%, 6%, 8%, 11%, 14%, 17%, 14%, 11%, 8%, 6%, 3%

This is as expectedbecause say for sum to be 2, there is only 1 possibility 1+1, 
so its chance of occuring is merely 1/36 = 3%. However, take sum = 7 for example, 
this has the highest chance of occuring because there are 6 possibilities in 
which it could occur: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
Due to this nature, the distribution is expected to be:
Total on dice	Pairs of dice	              Probability
    2	        1+1	                      1/36 = 3%
    3	        1+2, 2+1	              2/36 = 6%
    4	        1+3, 2+2, 3+1	              3/36 = 8%
    5	        1+4, 2+3, 3+2, 4+1	      4/36 = 11%
    6	        1+5, 2+4, 3+3, 4+2, 5+1	      5/36 = 14%
    7	        1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1  6/36 = 17%
    8	        2+6, 3+5, 4+4, 5+3, 6+2	      5/36 = 14%
    9	        3+6, 4+5, 5+4, 6+3	      4/36 = 11%
   10	        4+6, 5+5, 6+4	              3/36 = 8%
   11	        5+6, 6+5	              2/36 = 6%
   12	        6+6	                      1/36 = 3%

Question 4:
From my results, I would stand at 18 since this value is extremely 
close to the blackjack value of 21, with a relatively low busting probability (40%).
I would not want to consider thresholds 19 or above since their busting probability are all
greater than 50%, which means that you are more likely to bust.

Question 5:
From my simulation, the player has a very slight edge in winning, just over 50% by about 1.5% to 3%.
Over a large number of games, there is definitely an increase in the chances of winning but with a small 
sample size, the difference is nearly none. Using card counting over multiple games is indeed a probable
method of profitting from Blackjack and much more reliable than simply relying on luck. One way you 
might leverage it to maximize your winnings is to bet on a spectrum, where the higher the card count, the
more you bet and vice versa.
